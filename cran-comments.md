## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Replaced backticks with undirected quotation marks in DESCRIPTION.

- Added small executable examples to exported functions.

- Included small media files in `inst/media` that are used in the examples of exported functions to make them more readable. These media files are exported as objects by the newly created `media-files.R`.
